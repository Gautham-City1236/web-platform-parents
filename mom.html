<h3>Etymology</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Bangalore_%28Baedeker%2C_1914%29.jpg/200px-Bangalore_%28Baedeker%2C_1914%29.jpg"align="right">
<p align="left">The name "Bangalore" represents a version of the city's original Kannada name Bengalūru.The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription"Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 CE. It states that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru", the "City of Guards". <br>
    <br>
    An apocryphal story recounts that the twelfth century Hoysala king Veera Ballala II, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru"."Bengalūru". Suryanath Kamath has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name, being derived from benga, known as the Indian Kino Tree, a species of dry and moist deciduous trees, that grew abundantly in the region.<br>
<br>
On 11 December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced that it had accepted a proposal by Jnanpith Award winner U. R. Ananthamurthy to rename Bangalore to Bengalūru.[28] On 27 September 2006, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the proposed name change.[29] The government of Karnataka accepted the proposal, and it was decided to officially implement the name change from 1 November 2006.The Union government approved this request, along with name changes for 11 other Karnataka cities, in October 2014, hence Bangalore was renamed to "Bengaluru" on 1 November 2014.

<h3>Geography</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Nandi_hillside.jpg/170px-Nandi_hillside.jpg"align="left">
<p align="right">
Bangalore lies in the southeast of the South Indian state of Karnataka. It is in the heart of the Mysore Plateau (a region of the larger Cretaceous Deccan Plateau) at an average elevation of 900 m (2,953 ft). It is located at 12.97°N 77.56°E and covers an area of 741 km2 (286 sq mi). The majority of the city of Bangalore lies in the Bangalore Urban district of Karnataka and the surrounding rural areas are a part of the Bangalore Rural district.Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal Lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. <br>
<br>
The topology of Bangalore is generally flat, though the western parts of the city are hilly. The highest point is Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli, which is 962 m (3,156 ft) and is situated to the north-west of the city. No major rivers run through the city, although the Arkavathi and South Pennar cross paths at the Nandi Hills, 60 km (37 mi) to the north. River Vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of Bangalore's sewage. A sewerage system, constructed in 1922, covers 215 km2 (83 sq mi) of the city and connects with five sewage treatment centres located in the periphery of Bangalore.

<h3>Climate</h3>
<img src="https://weather-and-climate.com/uploads/average-temperature-india-bangalore.png" align="right">
<p align="left">Bangalore has distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its high elevation, Bangalore generally gets a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make the summer uncomfortable. The coolest month is January with an average low temperature of 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of 35 °C (95 °F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Bangalore is 39.2 °C (103 °F) (recorded on 24 April 2016), the lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °C (46 °F) in January 1884. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 14 °C (57 °F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 36 °C (97 °F). <br>
<br>
Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons and the wettest months are September, October and August, in that order. The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. Most of the rainfall occurs during late afternoon/evening or night and rain before noon is infrequent.November 2015 (290.4 mm) was recorded as one of the wettest months in Bangalore with heavy rains causing severe flooding in some areas, and closure of a number of organisations for over a couple of days. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is 179 mm (7 in) recorded on 1 October 1997.

    <h3>Wildlife</h3>
    <img src="https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/f2/6b/dc.jpg"align="left">
    <p align="right">Among the most revered and reviled animals in India, snakes are also very common in Bangalore. Bangalore has about 40 species of snakes of which six are venomous. Most snakes, even venomous ones, will flee upon detection. They only stand their ground when provoked or unable to escape. The rotting piles of garbage that we often dismiss as “someone else’s problem” attract rodents, which in turn lure predators like snakes. Thus, as a result of surprise encounters with snakes, India suffers one million snakebites a year with about 50,000 fatalities reported. The only solution to symptoms of snakebite from a venomous snake is the administration of anti-venom, available at government hospitals. Snake repellents, mantras and other such remedies are ineffective.There are also many different jungle cats, found on the fringes of scrublands and other areas with moderate vegetation, these big cats take advantage of their inborn speed and dexterity to stalk prey such as quick-moving birds, reptiles and rodents, as well as to escape predators who are unfamiliar with her quick-footedness. There are also many bats, jackals, and slender loris which are like tiny monkeys.<br>
    <br>
There are also many wildlife sanctuaries, one great sanctuary is Bandipur National Park. Bandipur National Park is the most popular wildlife sanctuary near Bangalore. The wildlife reserve is located 215 km away on the border of Karnataka in the Chamarajanagar district. The history of the park dates back to ancient times when it served as a hunting base for the Maharaj of Mysore. With abundant species ranging from the lion, tigers, sambar, chital to mouse deer and gaur, it is one of the prime tourist destinations to set foot on while in the city. Another great sanctuary to visit is Bannerghatta National Park. Bannerghatta National Park is one of the most famous wildlife reserves in Bangalore. One can tour the entire national park in a secure vehicle to see animals enjoying their natural habitat. Here the wide variety of species ranges from lions, tigers to bears. Also 4 km away from the zoo is the Ragihalli Reserve Forest which is known for its stunning surroundings and is situated in the valley. Embarking on a journey to this sanctuary is one of the ideal things to do on a day off.

<h3>Food/Cusine</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Jalebi_Baby_4534.jpg" align="right">
<p align="left"> There are many great foods to try in Bangalore. Firstly, we have Chaat and Pani Puri. Though chaat isn’t native to Bangalore, the city loves it. Right from khatta-meetha pani puri to crispy bhel puri, you’ll find these delicious treats in stalls all around the city on cool evenings.  A few chaat varieties to try are dahi puri, aloo chaat, and samosa chaat. Next there are Rolls and Kebabs.The city’s numerous kebab joints will have you spoiled for choice. Right from whole grilled chicken to sheek kebabs and delicious Shawarma rolls, you can have it all.<br>
<br>
There are also Mangalore Buns, A favourite breakfast and tea-time treat from the Dakshina Kannada region, Mangalore buns are fluffy buns are made from a mix of wheat flour and bananas and are deep fried to a light golden-brown. These slightly sweet delicacies are often served with spicy coconut chutney or sambar for a balance of flavour. But with food you need drinks and fruit juice is perfect. No other city seems to love fresh fruit juice as much as Bangalore, especially during summer. Anything from sweet watermelon juice to thick avocado shakes, you’ll find it here. It all started off with Sri Ganesh Fruit Juice about 70 years ago and the craze has taken over the city. You’ll see everyone from school kids to guys who’ve just finished a workout heading here.<br>
<br>
There are also many sweets here. One is Jalebi, it is a sweet snack popular all over South Asia, North Africa and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. And finally there is Galub Jamun. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour. 25th of May is celebrated as world Gulab jamun Day.
